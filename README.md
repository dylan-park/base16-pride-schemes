# base16-pride-schemes
A collection of simple, high contrast, and usable pride themed color schemes based on the [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) framework. These schemes can be used alongside a builder to generate color themes for websites, CLIs, IDEs, chat programs, and almost anything else that uses a theme file. More information about how base16 styling works, check [here](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16/blob/main/styling.md).

This repository contains light and dark versions of a multitude of pride flag colors. You are free to utilize them, change them, or use them as a starting point for further theming endeavors as you see fit.

## Contributing
While I do try to include as many pride flags as I can in this collection, each one is still created and tested by hand, which can be time consuming. If there is a flag you want to create and you have the know-how, feel free to create a pull request and follow the format. Otherwise you can create an issue and it will be dealt with in due time.
